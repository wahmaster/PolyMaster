PolyMaster
A Mobile First Responsive Wordpress Development Theme

PolyMaster is based off Bones and TwentyThirteen. Since this theme 
makes use of new features found in WordPress V3.6 it is NOT bacward
compatible with earlier versions of WordPress.

From Bones I kept SCSS and dropped LESS.  I have nothing against 
LESS, but I had to settle on one or the other for my development and
LESS ended up getting the boot.

I tried to keep as much of the goodness of Bones and only pulling in 
what I felt was most interesting at the time from TwentyThirteen.

TODO:
Add more customization options for header background colors.
Add support for adding svg images to background setting customizations.
